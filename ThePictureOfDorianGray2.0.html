      <h1>About</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">"The Picture of Dorian Gray" by Oscar Wilde is a story of a young lad by the name of Dorian Gray who was considerably a handsome man living in the victorian era of London. The story starts off a steady and what could be described as hopeful when the characters are first introduced but things take a dark turn once Dorian was gifted with a splendid portrait of himself, as a gift from Basil Hallward. As Dorian looks upon the painting he wishes that he could stay just as young as the picture. Fortunately for him, he gets his wish.</h5>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Dorian begins to fall down a path of hedonism and has a not-so-steady moral decline. All while remaining young and beautiful, meanwhile his portrait changes with every action and every move that Dorian takes. Bearing the burden of growing old and the consequences of immoral actions.</h5>

      <h1>Character Profiles</h1>
      <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><img src="Basil Hallward.jfif"> Hallward - Basil is a painter who once just painted for the hell of it but once he laid eyes upon the outrageously stunning Dorian Gray, Basil just had to have him. He began to adore Dorain's youth and made Dorian his subject to his art. Through his art, Basil had grown attached to Dorian and feared how he would turn out if he had met Lord Henry.</h5>
      <br>
       <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><img src="Dorian Gray.jfif"> Gray - Dorian Gray is a young lad, who doesn't have a care in the world...at least not until he had met Basil and Henry. Dorian appeared to have been fine with Basil's calm nature but alas, after meeting Henry, he becomes rather impatient with Basil and cursed him for giving him such a horrendous painting. As he learned throughout the story, the painting changed with every single action. It was a reflection of his soul after all.</h5>
       <br>
       <h5 class="w3-padding-32"><img src="Lord Henry.jfif">Henry Wotton - Henry is the type of person who's only there for you when it's convient for him. You can't expect him to show up unless it's a life or death situation (maybe not even then). However, Dorian somehow saw something in Henry that caused Henry to become obbessed with the idea of molding Dorian into a brainless minion. Which - for Henry - turned out perfectly. Dorian began taking Henry's words to heart and listening to every word that fell from Henry's lips as if he was starving child. One could say that Henry was partially to blame for the events that followed as Dorian became older.</h5>

    <p><em>What are some literary elements?</em></p>
    <p>The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many literary elements, so let's go over a few.</p>

    <h3>Symbolism</h3>
    <p><h4>The Painting</h4></p>
    <p>The painting symbolizes the physical and moral decline of Dorian Gray while he remains young and beautiful. The painting also represents the consequences of wandering too far down the path of hedonism and the aftermath of moral corruption.</p>
    <h3>Satire</h3>
    <p><h4>Obbessed With Youth</h4></p>
    <p>Dorian makes it clear throughout the story that he has a strong desire for remaining young and beautiful and to never gorw old. This was the perfect example of how far people are actually willing to go when it comes to doing anything for enternal youth. Even if it means sacrificing their soul/morality</p>
    <h3>Allusion</h3>
    <p><h4>Oscar Wilde's Life</h4></p>
    <p>Throughout the story, the reader can see bits and pieces of Wilde's own life experiences along with just bits and pieces of his life in general. Wilde not only incorporated himself into the sotry but also the way that society was protrayed at the time, which as the reader can tell, wasn't exactly the best.</p>
    <h3>Paradox</h3>
    <p><h4>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done. You must certainly send it somewhere." - Lord Henry</h4></p>
    <p>Lord Henry gives praise to Basil's artwork after being face to face with it. It certianly does capture the innonce of Dorian Gray so it would make sense that Henry would suggest for Basil to put it somewhere where the entire world can see it. Although, sadly, it's the portraitthat captures Dorain's moral corruption.</p>
